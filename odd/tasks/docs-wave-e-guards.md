# docs-wave-e-guards

Issue: #5234 (tracker #4556). PR 1 branch: `docs/5234-retired-term-guard` from upstream/main 7af7eef8. PR 2 gets its own branch from main; the two PRs are independent, not stacked.
Goal: Go-test guards so retired terms and hardcoded inventories cannot drift back into living docs.

## Specs

- S1 Retired-term guard: "Extend the existing test to walk every living doc: `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `docs/**`. Exclude historical material: `docs/audits/`, `docs/releases/`, `docs/architecture/rdd-*`, and pages flagged as historical." Existing guard: `internal/app/documented_invocation_test.go:409-414` (`/sdd-`, `/gentle-sdd-`, `gentle-ai sdd-`, `SDD phases`, `SDD agents`, `OpenSpec`).
- S2 "Allow only explicit retirement or legacy notes, through a small, reviewed allowlist. Examples are the "retired in v4.0.0" notes and the legacy `sdd-*` telemetry schema values (`docs/telemetry.md`)."
- S3 "Add `--strict-tdd` to the retired list." Do not ban "Strict TDD" (current, `agentguidance/strict_tdd.go`) or "shadow" (ambiguous).
- S4 "Clean the leftovers listed above so the guard starts green." — `docs/engram.md:159`, `docs/testing-agents-deterministically.md:70,71,251`.
- S5 "Reword the template checkbox: "If behavior changed, docs in `docs/` are updated in the same PR (reference docs track `main`).""
- S6 "Add a test that fails when `docs/agents.md` and `allAgents` disagree. The failure lists missing and extra agents."
- S7 "Add a test that keeps the `README.md` agents badge equal to `len(allAgents)`."
- S8 "Add a test that fails when the component trees in `docs/architecture.md` and `docs/codebase/repository-map.md` miss or invent a package under `internal/components/`."
- S9 "Fix any drift these tests find."
- Decision: drift tests, not generated blocks (no `go generate`, no Markdown markers). Each PR under 400 lines.
